# Face Recognition Attendance System
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
This project involves building an attendance system which utilizes facial recognition to mark the presence, time-in, and time-out of employees. It covers areas such as facial detection, alignment, and recognition, along with the development of a web application to cater to various use cases of the system such as registration of new employees, addition of photos to the training dataset, viewing attendance reports, etc. This project intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional manual attendance systems. It can be used in corporate offices, schools, and organizations where security is essential.

This project aims to automate the traditional attendance system where the attendance is marked manually. It also enables an organization to maintain its records like in-time, out time, break time and attendance digitally. Digitalization of the system would also help in better visualization of the data using graphs to display the no. of employees present today, total work hours of each employee and their break time. Its added features serve as an efficient upgrade and replacement over the traditional attendance system.

# Scope of the project 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Facial recognition is becoming more prominent in our society. It has made major progress in the field of security. It is a very effective tool that can help low enforcers to recognize criminals and software companies are leveraging the technology to help users access the technology. This technology can be further developed to be used in other avenues such as ATMs, accessing confidential files, or other sensitive materials. This project servers as a foundation for future projects based on facial detection and recognition. This project also convers web development and database management with a user-friendly UI. Using this system any corporate offices, school and organization can replace their traditional way of maintaining attendance of the employees and can also generate their availability(presence) report throughout the month.


## Motivation :astonished:
----------------------------
I seek to provide a valuable attendance service for both teachers and students. Reduce manual process errors by provide automated and a reliable attendance system uses face recognition technology.

## Installation :key:
-----------------------------------

#### Download or Clone the project

First Download or Clone the Project on Your Local Machine.To download the project from github press **Download Zip**

or 

You can clone the project with git bash.To clone the project using git bash first open the git bash 
```

After download, Open the project using **Pycharm or VSCODE**. Then we have to create an python enviroment to run the program.

#### create enviroment 
First open the terminal or command line in the IDE.Then write the following code.
```
python -m venv env
```
Then activate the enviroment using the code below for windows.
```
.\env\Scripts\activate
```
[ *Notice:*
If your pc don't have virtual enviroment or pip install the follow this link.
[How to create Virtual Enviroment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) ]

#### Installing the packages
--------------------------------------------------

After creating the enviroment on your project let's install the necessary packages. 

![pip install demo]

To install those package open the terminal or command line and paste the code from below

```
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install pandas
```
```
pip install Pillow
```
```
pip install pytest-shutil
```
```
pip install python-csv
```
```
pip install yagmail
```

[ **Notice: During the package installization, sometime it shows some error, to avoid those error you can install those packages as admin. ]

## Test Run :bicyclist:
-----------------------
After creating the enviroment and installing the packages, open the IDE terminal/command line to run the program. Using the code below.

```
py main.py
```
